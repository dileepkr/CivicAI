# Race Condition Fix Test

## What was fixed:

1. **Added `waitingForUserInput` state**: Tracks when the debate is specifically waiting for user input vs. just paused
2. **Added `isUserInteracting` ref**: Prevents timeout execution when user is actively interacting
3. **Improved timeout management**: All timeouts are cleared when user starts typing
4. **Better state synchronization**: Debate state and execution flow are now properly coordinated
5. **Enhanced UI feedback**: Visual indicators show when waiting for user input

## Test Steps:

1. Start a debate
2. Let it run for a few messages
3. Type in the input field while debate is running
4. Send a message
5. Verify that:
   - Debate pauses immediately when you start typing
   - AI responses are generated to your input
   - Resume button is disabled while waiting for input
   - "Waiting for input" badge appears
   - Debate doesn't automatically resume after AI responses
   - Manual resume works correctly

## Key Improvements:

- **No more race conditions**: User input properly interrupts and controls the debate flow
- **Clear state management**: Debate knows when it's waiting for user vs. just paused
- **Better UX**: Users get clear feedback about the current state
- **Robust execution**: Timeouts are properly managed and don't conflict with user interaction
