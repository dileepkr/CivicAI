## Technical Details

### Backend Services
```
GET /policies           - List all policies
GET /policies/{id}      - Get specific policy
POST /debates/start     - Start new debate
WS /debates/{id}/stream - Real-time debate stream
```

### Frontend Components
```
PolicyList.tsx     - Policy selection and search
DebatePanel.tsx    - Real-time debate interface
EmailGenerator.tsx - Email creation from debates
```

## Current Test Data

The system includes sample policies:
- **policy_1**: Housing/rental policy
- **policy_2**: Additional policy data

## Next Steps

### For Development
1. Add more policy test data in `test_data/`
2. Enhance search functionality
3. Add user authentication
4. Implement file upload processing

### For Production
1. Set up proper environment variables
2. Configure production CORS
3. Add SSL/HTTPS
4. Set up monitoring and logging

## Troubleshooting

### If Backend Stops
```bash
cd api
python main.py &
```

### If Frontend Stops
```bash
cd policy-pulse-debate
npm run dev
```

### Port Conflicts
- Backend: Change port in `api/main.py`
- Frontend: Change port in `vite.config.ts`
- Update CORS settings accordingly
