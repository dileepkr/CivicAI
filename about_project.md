# About the Project

## Inspiration
Hardy faced a 26.5% rent raise after only 6 months of moving into a rental in the Bay Area üòî. This jarring experience revealed a fundamental problem with civic engagement: citizens lack the tools to navigate the adversarial nature of policy-making. While access to information is a known issue, the more critical barrier is that policies are presented as dense, one-sided documents, leaving people unable to grasp inherent trade-offs, understand opposing viewpoints, or form well-rounded opinions. This prevents effective advocacy for their interests.

This personal experience sparked the vision for CivicAI - a platform that could democratize policy understanding by simulating the multi-stakeholder debates that happen behind closed doors, making complex policy trade-offs accessible to every citizen.

## What it does
CivicAI is a sophisticated multi-agent AI system that transforms policy documents into dynamic, NotebookLM-style debates between stakeholders. The platform features:

### ü§ñ **Dynamic Multi-Agent Debates**
- **Intelligent Stakeholder Identification**: Automatically identifies relevant stakeholders (tenants, landlords, city officials, housing advocates) for any policy
- **Real-time Adversarial Debates**: AI agents representing different perspectives engage in structured, moderated discussions
- **Universal Policy Framework**: Works across domains - housing, labor, public safety, environment, and more
- **Human-like Personas**: Agents with distinct personalities, backgrounds, and emotional responses for authentic representation

### üéØ **Personalized Civic Engagement**
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Upload documents (leases, contracts, licenses) to determine your stakeholder role
- **Targeted Policy Discovery**: Intelligent search across federal, state, and local levels using Exa API
- **Professional Email Generation**: Creates personalized advocacy emails to appropriate representatives
- **Multi-Level Government Integration**: Connects users to relevant city council members, state representatives, and federal officials

### üí° **Interactive Learning**
- **Jump-in Debates**: Users can participate in live debates, ask questions, and express viewpoints
- **Trade-off Visualization**: Clear presentation of policy implications across different stakeholder groups
- **Balanced Summaries**: Unbiased synthesis of complex multi-party discussions

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

### ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Coordination**
**Challenge**: Ensuring authentic stakeholder representation without harmful stereotypes while maintaining coherent debates between 2-4 agents simultaneously.

**Solution**: Developed a sophisticated persona system with detailed backgrounds, speech patterns, and emotional triggers. Implemented A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols for structured communication and conflict resolution mechanisms for fundamental disagreements.

### üîç **Dynamic Policy Discovery**
**Challenge**: Building a system that works across diverse policy domains (housing, labor, environment) with varying government structures and terminology.

**Solution**: Created a universal policy classification system using Exa API's semantic search capabilities. Implemented cross-domain knowledge bases and automated stakeholder mapping algorithms that adapt to different policy contexts.

### ‚ö° **Real-time Debate Streaming**
**Challenge**: Delivering smooth, interactive debate experiences while processing complex LLM operations and maintaining conversation coherence.

**Solution**: Implemented WebSocket architecture with optimized message queuing, response caching, and parallel agent processing. Created modular debate systems that can scale from simple demonstrations to complex multi-stakeholder discussions.

### üéØ **Contextual Personalization**
**Challenge**: Accurately determining user stakeholder roles from diverse document types (leases, contracts, licenses) while protecting privacy.

**Solution**: Developed multi-format document parsing with privacy-preserving analysis. Created stakeholder role extraction algorithms that work across different document types and automatically map users to relevant policies and representatives.

### üåê **Cross-Platform Integration**
**Challenge**: Seamlessly connecting React frontend with Python backend while maintaining real-time capabilities and handling complex state management.

**Solution**: Designed RESTful APIs with FastAPI, implemented robust CORS configuration, and created efficient state synchronization between frontend and backend debate systems.
