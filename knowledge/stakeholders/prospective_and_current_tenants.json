'optional' services, as landlords cannot condition tenancy or its terms on their selection, and such services must be freely selectable/rejectable and cancelable.\",\n      \"Establishes a clear payment hierarchy, prioritizing the application of tenant payments to current month's rent first, then outstanding rental debt, significantly reducing the risk of eviction for non-rent charges.\",\n

enhances protections for prospective and current tenants by mandating clear, 'all-in' pricing for rental properties, eliminating hidden fees and ensuring predictable housing costs. It strictly defines and limits 'optional housing services,' preventing landlords from coercing tenants into unwanted add-ons or evicting them for non-payment of such services. Crucially, it reorders payment priorities to cover rent first, bolstering housing stability. The policy also introduces stringent transparency and fairness requirements for Ratio Utility Billing Systems (RUBS, specifically for water/sewer), including mandatory landlord contributions for common area utilities. Tenants gain a powerful direct cause of action with statutory damages and attorney's fees, enabling effective enforcement of these new rights and promoting a more equitable and transparent rental market.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"high\"\n}",
