\"research_summary\": \"This policy significantly impacts landlords by imposing strict rent increase caps and prohibiting most additional fees, directly hindering their ability to maximize rental income and profitability. The mandatory 90-day notice for increases adds an administrative layer, while substantial penalties for non-compliance ($1,000 per violation plus damages and attorney fees) introduce significant legal and financial risks. For landlords, the ordinance conflicts with core interests such as maximizing income, operational efficiency, and minimizing legal risks. It is expected to lead to reduced investment in rental properties, potential decline in property maintenance, and increased compliance costs, fostering strong opposition from this stakeholder group.\",\n  \"confidence_level\": \"high\"\n}",
